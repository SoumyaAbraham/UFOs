# UFOs

### Overview  
A large amount of data related to possible UFO sightings is provided. To make it more accessible to UFO enthusiasts, a webpage is created with a brief introductory welcome and filter options for the rather long table full of juicy data!
For a more dynamic experience, the following searches options are added:  
  - date
  - city
  - state
  - country
  - shape  

This opens up the floor for various avenues of analysis based on the factors that can be filtered. UFO-enthusists everywhere can have hoards of data at their fingertip and parcel it in groups with the filtering feature.  

### Deliverable 1  

By default, the table shows information, by date. Multiple search options have been added.  
Let us take a look at what the website looks like: 

![webpage](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/screenshots/webpage.png)  

Notice there are placeholders to show how the searches should be made. For example, *Country* is co. This indicated that the search should be made with two letter abbreviations. 
Similarily, there is a placeholder to show the accepted format for search by Date.  

### Result  
Let us take a look at how each search should be done and how the results show up:   

#### Examples of Search:

  1. _Search by Date_  
  
  ![search_by_date](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/screenshots/date_search.png)  
  
  All the sightings from  *1/5/2020* are visible.  
  
  2. _Search by City_
  
  ![search_by_City](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/screenshots/city_search.png)
  
  There are three sightings in *San Diego* that can be seen.  
  
  3. _Search by State_
  
![search_by_state](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/screenshots/state_search.png)
  
  There are 3 sightings in Oregon which are visible in the table, when searched for by *Or*. 
  
  4. _Search by Country_
  
  ![search_by_country](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/screenshots/country_search.png)
  
  All the sightings in the *US* are presented in the table.  
  
  5. _Search by Shape_
  
  ![search_by_shape](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/screenshots/shape_search.png) 
  
  There are 5 sightings that are recorded to have  *formation* shape.  
  
  6. _Multiple Searches_ 
   
  ![multi_search](https://github.com/SoumyaAbraham/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/screenshots/multi_search.png)  
  
  You can add multiple searched to narrow down the sighting(s) users are interested in. 
  
  If no search is inserted, the complete table will be visible.  
  
### Summary  

While the webpage is turning out nicely, there are a couple drawbacks:

  1. While the data may look extensive, it is only from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. Expanding the time frame will give better incidents to look over.  
  2. The information is also only from the United States. Once again, expanding the areas of interest can give a more rounded perspective on incidences observed around the globe.

A few suggestions to improve the website:  

  1. Data collected over a larger period of time, with a broader area of interest can vastly improve the quality of the subsequent analysis.  
  2. Adding a dropdown for the search options can make it easier for users to choose from the available choices, rather than looking through the table to know what searches can be done. 
  3. Visualization aids like an interactive map or charts marking the various types of formations or the number of sightings seen per state can be helpful in the analysis procedure.
